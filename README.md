# My Awesome WM config

================================================================================

My configuration based on the default awesome wm config usually located in
/etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua. I've broken the monolithic config into multiple
smaller related chunks in a way that is easer to understand. I've also made
the following changes:

1. Added a primative text based battery widget.
2. Removed the default app runnner.
3. Added keybinds for Rofi
4. Changed the defualt terminal to Alacritty and the text editor to Neovim.
5. Added a keybind to run a custom lock session script which relies on i3-lock.
6. Added a keybind to take screenshots with maim.
7. Added power options to the defualt launche menu.
8. Added keybinds for my volume keys to adjust the volume with pamixer.

I've put this up on github mostly as a back up for myself, and as a possible
reference for anyone else who's using awesome wm.
